      <div class="review-text">
        <p>I can wholeheartedly recommend Marc as a mathematics tutor. As a classmate of our children, we know him as an approachable, open-minded, and determined young person who completes his tasks with great care and success. Marc impresses with his calm, patient nature and his ability to explain even complex mathematical concepts in a clear and structured way. We especially appreciate his personable manner — our child feels safe, respected, and motivated with him.</p>

        <p>Marc has been tutoring mathematics at the German School London since he was 14 — with great success. After his first student, all others came through recommendations and word of mouth. Marc is not only outstanding in mathematics (15 points in the Abitur and a special award from the department), but also has a talent for explaining complicated topics clearly and responding to his students’ needs.</p>

      <div class="review-text">
        <p>We used Marc in Richmond/UK for maths tutoring at the German School London for our eldest son (Years 8–10). Marc’s lessons significantly reduced pressure at home. Boys working with boys just works better! He conveyed the material very well in a friendly relationship, always radiated calm and composure, and was highly flexible with last-minute problems or tests. We could always rely on him — even with scheduling.</p>

      <div class="review-name">Max</div>
      <div class="review-text">
        <p>He explains everything very well, prepares for each lesson, and plans ahead. He gives a bit of homework to ensure constant repetition.</p>

        <p>I’m so glad Marc has been helping my son with maths for four years! He inspires his students and teaches even complex topics in a simple way. And the improvement in grades was visible very quickly. I can recommend him without reservation.</p>
